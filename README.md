ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HectorHW (that's just a nickname, IRL people really call me Vladimir RedkinğŸ¤ª)

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Russian student interested in everything connected with programming languages, interpreters and compilers.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deeping my knowledge in Rust and writing interpreter by following [Crafing Interpreters by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

ğŸ“« if you wish, you can reach me by my uni email: vsredkin[at]stud.kpfu.ru
